/**
 * TangleClaw to Discord (#2031, ADR 0023 Decision 11).
 *
 * Each pass claims what waits at the bridge, posts each item to the one
 * allowlisted channel, and acknowledges it under its lease only once Discord
 * has returned the posted message's id. Nothing is acknowledged on hope.
 *
 * A lease gives the helper two minutes; it does not make a post safe to
 * repeat. Three things do, together:
 *
 * - **The bridge's record of parts.** Each message Discord makes is reported
 *   at once. A later claim of the same item says which parts are already
 *   posted, so whoever picks the item up carries on after them. A reply to a
 *   posted part is known for what it answers from that moment.
 * - **The helper's own record** (`state.js`), for the one thing the bridge
 *   cannot know: an attempt whose outcome is in doubt. Before a part goes out
 *   the entry records that an attempt began (`since`). A failure Discord
 *   definitely did not act on clears it, but only when that same attempt set
 *   it. A failure that may have posted keeps it.
 * - **Discord's nonce.** A retry of an attempt in doubt reuses its nonce, so
 *   inside Discord's de-duplication window it returns the message already
 *   made. Past that window a retry could duplicate, so the item is held as
 *   `uncertain`, never reposted by itself.
 *
 * The helper discards nothing. What it cannot post it reports, with a reason
 * from the bridge's closed list. A reason a retry may fix leaves the item
 * waiting. One it will not (Discord rejects the content, the bot may not post
 * in the channel, an outcome that can no longer be verified) has the bridge
 * set the item aside and tell the operator; it stays there until the Project
 * Master or the operator puts it back or withdraws it.
 *
 * The nonce of a claim is recorded before the claim is made, and cleared only
 * when everything it handed over has been dealt with. Until then each pass
 * asks the same claim again first, and the bridge returns the same leases. So
 * a lost answer, a pass that stopped part-way and a restart all carry on with
 * what was already handed over, without waiting for a lease to lapse.
 *
 * An item is checked before it is posted: its text against the digest it was
 * handed over with, and the channel it names against the allowlisted one. The
 * helper posts to that one channel and no other, whatever an item says.
 *
