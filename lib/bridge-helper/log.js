 * The helper relays a third-party chat and holds two secrets, so what it may
 * write is a closed vocabulary, not a free-form message. A caller passes a
 * code and, at most, numeric or id-shaped fields. Message text, tokens,
 * headers and Discord's raw answers have no field to travel in. A code this
 * file does not define is written as `unknown-code`, so a mistake in a caller
 * cannot become a leak.
