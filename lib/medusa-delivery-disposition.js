/**
 * What a held Medusa wake means for the people waiting on it (#2086).
 *
 * The wake monitor explains every wake it withholds with a reason code. A
 * code says what was observed. It does not say whether waiting will fix it,
 * and that is the thing a sender, and anyone reading the fleet's undelivered
 * list, needs to know. This module is the one place that answers it.
 *
 * Three classes:
 *
 *   - `actionable`: the recipient is live and the monitor retries by itself.
 *     A busy pane, a wrap in progress, a listener reconnecting. Waiting fixes it.
 *   - `configuration`: the recipient is live and nothing changes until someone
 *     acts. Wake not opted in, an engine with no wake profile. Waiting does not
 *     fix it.
 *   - `historical`: the recipient session is not live. Its mail went with it.
 *
 * And a fourth, `none`, for the codes that are not a held wake at all (nudged,
 * no mail), which only the sender-facing answer can carry.
 *
 * Two rules decide the doubtful cases, and both fail towards a person looking:
 *
 *   - A code this table does not know is `configuration`, to be investigated.
 *     Never `actionable`, which would promise a retry nobody has shown will
 *     happen, and never `historical`, which would write the mail off.
 *   - `historical` needs a positive answer that the session is not live. Not
 *     knowing is not that answer.
 *
 * Pure: no requires, no clock of its own, nothing written. The reason
 * vocabulary is `lib/medusa-wake.js#PEER_REASON_MEANINGS`; a test holds this
 * table against it, so a new code without a class turns red.
