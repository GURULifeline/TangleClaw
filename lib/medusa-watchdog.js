/**
 * Medusa delivery watchdog (#1839): the server-owned timer.
 *
 * A deterministic loop over durable exchange state, not an agent: it spends no
 * turns, depends on no inbox of its own, and survives a restart because
 * everything it decides from is in the exchange record. It never injects
 * anything. What it may do is re-arm a wake, which only lets the wake monitor
 * (`lib/medusa-wake.js`) try again, through every gate, for a message whose
 * nudge provably did not land, or whose session became ready again after it.
 *
 * Re-arm rules, read from the attempt history rather than the latest verdict
 * (a reconnect or a busy pane after an attempt does not undo the attempt):
 * - Only an exchange that has been attempted, with nothing read or
 *   acknowledged, no re-arm already pending, and no receipt saying the engine
 *   accepted the nudge. Accepted-but-unread is for escalation, not another wake.
 * - A re-arm needs a durable trigger newer than the attempt: a negative
 *   receipt (its nonce left in the composer), which is eligible at once, or a
 *   persisted readiness change (the gates found the session ineligible after
 *   the nudge and eligible again since), which is eligible once
 *   `rearmAfterMs` has also passed. Elapsed time alone never re-arms and never
 *   spends budget: an attempt with neither trigger stays unconfirmed and is
 *   left to escalate by age.
 * - Each re-arm sets a persisted `next_eligible_at` from a backoff schedule,
 *   and the count is capped. Both live in the record, so duplicate ticks and a
 *   restart mid-backoff re-arm nothing twice.
 *
 * Escalation (chunk 04): an open exchange that stays unread, or unanswered
 * after an ack when a reply is required, climbs a one-way ladder: `aged` (the
 * sender is told), `escalated` (the escalation route on the recipient's
 * control assignment is told), `operator` (the dashboard shows it and it is
 * logged). Normal mail skips the `escalated` rung: it is aged, and reaches
 * the operator once for one of the reasons `_normalOperatorReason` names.
 * Each rung is reached once, from server
 * time, and recorded before any notice is sent, so a duplicate tick or a
 * restart never repeats a notice. A notice is recorded as queued, then accepted
 * (the Hub stored it, which is not "delivered") or failed. A target that cannot
 * receive it is recorded as undeliverable, and the operator alert stands.
 * Notices carry ids, ages, codes and names only, never message text. They come
 * from `system`, so they never become exchanges themselves.
