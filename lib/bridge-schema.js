 * `bridgeTablesDdl()`, and every startup runs `verifyBridgeSchema()`, so a
 * fresh install, an upgraded store and a store somebody edited by hand are all
 * held to the same shape.
 *
 * Nothing here touches `medusa_exchanges`. A message the bridge sends is an
 * ordinary tracked exchange; what makes it the bridge's is the proof row in
 * `bridge_route_proofs`, keyed to the exact route and Hub id.

/**
 * DDL for every bridge table, in its final shape.

 * Tables only; {@link bridgeIndexDdl} holds the indexes and triggers and
 * {@link createBridgeSchema} runs both in order. Idempotent (`IF NOT EXISTS`
 * throughout). Purely additive: a server that
 * predates the bridge ignores these tables, so the rows survive a rollback and
 * a re-upgrade.
 *
 * - `bridge_settings`: the operator's local switches. Absent `enabled` means off.
 * - `bridge_master_credentials`: verification material for the Master
 *   principal, one row per generation. The credential itself is never stored.
 * - `bridge_helper_tokens`: verification material for the chat helper's scoped
 *   token, hash only.
 * - `bridge_nonces`: request nonces already seen from the helper.
 * - `bridge_routes`: one row per inbound operator message, unique on the
 *   chat's own message id so a replay can never become a second message.
 * - `bridge_route_bodies`: the text of a route, held apart so it can be
 *   cleared after delivery or close while the route record stays.
 * - `bridge_route_proofs`: which Hub message belongs to which route, and under
 *   what proof. A reply is the bridge's only if this table says so.
 * - `bridge_outbound`: what waits for the helper. Every row has its own
 *   idempotency key; `hub_id` is nullable because most kinds never had one.
 * - `bridge_outbound_claims`, `bridge_outbound_leases`: each time the helper
 *   collected, and the lease each item was handed over under. An
 *   acknowledgement names its lease, so the store knows what a helper held
 *   and until when.
 * - `bridge_outbound_parts`: every message the chat confirmed, by the chat's
 *   own id, with the item it is a part of and what that item was. Kept after
 *   the item is removed, so a reply to any posted message can still be told
 *   apart from a message that answers nothing.
 * - `bridge_route_reply_context`: for an inbound message that answers a posted
 *   message, which one, fixed when the message is accepted.
 * - `bridge_candidates`, `bridge_candidate_receipts`: facts a session offers
 *   Master, each bound to the receipts it rests on by id and digest.
 * - `bridge_aliases`, `bridge_pins`: routing policy. Global entries are the
 *   operator's; Master may hold a conversation-scoped pin only.
 * - `bridge_audit`, `bridge_audit_anchor`: every bridge write. A row is never
 *   updated, and leaves only when a compaction moves the single anchor row
 *   past it; the anchor keeps a count and a chained digest of everything that
 *   has left, so what retention removes stays bounded and accounted for. A request id is unique per operation, which is what
 *   makes a repeated write return its first result.
 * @returns {string}
