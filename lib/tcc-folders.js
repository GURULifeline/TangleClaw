 * The home-directory folders macOS protects with TCC, named once (#880).

 * A launchd-spawned node with no Full Disk Access gets no prompt and no EPERM
 * under these: a read simply never answers (#859). Every node-side place that
 * detects them or tells an operator about them reads this module, so the list
 * and the sentence that names it cannot drift apart. The browser gets the list
 * itself from the server, as `config.protectedRoots` (built by
 * `protectedRootsFor`). The copies that cannot import this module are prose
 * and shell: the wizard's caution in `public/setup.js`, the EACCES hint in
 * `public/api-helper.js`, and `deploy/install.sh`. `test/tcc-folders.test.js`
 * checks each against this list.
 *
 * Free of project dependencies on purpose (only `node:path`): `lib/uploads.js`,
 * `lib/project-facts.js` and the rest require it for a string, and must not
 * pull in anything to get one.
