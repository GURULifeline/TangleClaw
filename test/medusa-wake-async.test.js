/*
 * Non-blocking pane reads in the wake monitor (#2086).
 *
 * The timer-driven tick starts a read for every session holding mail and
 * returns. Each read is judged when it answers, on its own. What must hold:
 *
 *   - a hung pane delays nobody: a later recipient is woken as fast as if the
 *     hung pane were not there, and the tick itself takes no time;
 *   - a read's answer is never acted on blind: the whole gate chain runs again
 *     on the session as it is NOW, so a wrap, a rotation, a replacement, mail
 *     already read or a wake already recorded refuses the nudge;
 *   - a tick that did not get a look at a pane (a read still in flight, a
 *     timeout, a read error, a backoff) is not an observation of it;
 *   - one read per session at a time, and nothing after `stop()`.
 *
 * Time is the synthetic fleet's virtual clock.
