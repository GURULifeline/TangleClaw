/*
 * Early warning for the release notes gate (#2080). The release workflow
 * refuses notes over the gate's ceiling and never truncates them, so an
 * oversized [Unreleased] section would only be discovered at the version bump,
 * after everything in it has merged. This fails at merge time instead, on the
 * PR whose entry crosses the line, while there is still room to condense.
 *
 * What is measured is the file the release would publish, byte for byte. The
 * version bump promotes [Unreleased] under a version heading unchanged, and
 * release.yml then runs `node lib/changelog-notes.js <version> >
 * release-notes.md`. So the section is promoted in a scratch copy and that same
 * command writes the file that is counted, trailing newline included. Counting
 * the extractor's return value instead would come up a byte short.
